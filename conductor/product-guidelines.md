# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity & Aesthetic
- **Tone:** Playful & Friendly. The interface should feel approachable and low-stakes, reducing the intimidation factor for non-technical users.
- **Design Language:** Rounded corners for all UI elements (buttons, cards, nodes), ample whitespace, and smooth transitions.
- **Color Palette:** Soft pastel tones including mint greens, sky blues, and light corals. This palette should evoke a sense of calm and creativity.

## User Interactions & Feedback
- **Feedback Loops:** Use a combination of playful toast notifications and subtle micro-animations.
    - **Toasts:** Use colorful pop-ups with friendly icons or emojis to celebrate successes or gently notify of issues.
    - **Animations:** Employ gentle bounces for successful actions and subtle shakes for errors to provide organic, tactile feedback.
- **Status Visibility:** Visual cues on workflow nodes to clearly indicate whether a step is pending, running, or completed.

## Prose & Communication
- **Voice:** Friendly & Conversational.
- **Style:** Encouraging and informal. Labels and instructions should use active, welcoming language (e.g., "Let's build something awesome!", "Tell us about your new pattern").
- **Language:** Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, translating complex CLI concepts into intuitive visual terms.
